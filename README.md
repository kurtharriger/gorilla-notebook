# Gorilla Notebook

Gorilla Notebook is a notebook style editor for Clojure. If you're interested you should take a look at its
[website](http://gorilla-repl.org).

## Experimental

This is an attempt to create a more fully featured editor for gorilla-repl by hosting it within atom-shell.  

The editor does not currently start gorilla-repl.  This must be running on localhost port 8990 before editor will function. 

## Installation

Mac OS X only.  

`./install.sh`

Atom shell does support multiple platforms, however the install script assumes OS X. Pull request welcome.

## Licence

Gorilla is licensed to you under the MIT licence. See LICENCE.txt for details.
